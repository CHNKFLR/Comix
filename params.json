{"name":"Comix","tagline":"A Load Balancing Reverse Proxy Server for Minecraft Server Networks.","body":"### Comix.\r\nComix is a Load Balancing Reverse Proxy Server for Minecraft Server Networks which is build to be high-performancing and to have a high-availability.\r\nAlso it was designed from the ground up to have as many settings for configuration and uniqueness as possible for your server.\r\n\r\n### Why Comix and not a DNS-LB?\r\nComix will know if a server went offline or back online and will automatically remove or add the server from the load-balancing system. So you don't have to worry that your players will try to join through an offline Proxy.\r\nPlayers will only ping and request information such as MOTD or favicon. Comix will arrange that not one of your Proxies will have to deal with unnecessary requests - less work for your Proxies. \r\nAll options like MOTD or for example the MOTD in the maintenance mode are configurable and you only have to edit it once because the Proxies no longer have to process this requests. Another cool feature is that you can go live in maintenance mode with Comix by merely using one command.\r\n\r\nA very important feature is that the only thing that must be open to the internet is your Comix ip and the port 25565 where Comix is running.\r\nNobody can know how many Proxies you have or which port there are running - nothing.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- IP-Blacklist\r\n- Commands (help, reload, kickall, etc..)\r\n- Whitelist (choose where is allowed to join, or allow all)\r\n- Customizable Ping Response (MOTD, online players, max players and sample text)\r\n- Colored MOTD\r\n- Maintenance mode (custom MOTD, custom kick message, custom version string)\r\n- Logging\r\n- Online/Offline detection for servers (automatically removing and adding to the LB)\r\n- Custom Address and Port binding for the Load-Balancer\r\n- As many target Server as you want\r\n- Load Balancing with simple Round-Robin\r\n- Based on Netty for high performance\r\n- Monitoring (in work)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any trouble with the configuration or would like to look up some commands feel free to visit the [Comix Wiki](https://github.com/JackWhite20/Comix/wiki).\r\nHave you found an error or a bug? Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/JackWhite20/Comix/issues) with a detailed description.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
