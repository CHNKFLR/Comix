{"name":"Comix","tagline":"A Load Balancing Reverse Proxy Server for Minecraft Server Networks.","body":"### Comix.\r\nComix is a Load Balancing Reverse Proxy Server for Minecraft Server Networks which is build to be high-performance and to have a high-availability.\r\nAlso it was design from the ground up to have as many opportunities for configuration and uniqueness for your server.\r\n\r\n### Why Comix and not a DNS-LB?\r\nComix will know if a server went offline or back online and will automatically remove or add the server from the load-balancing system. So you don't have to worry that your players will try to join an offline Proxy.\r\nPlayers will only ping Comix and not one of you Proxies - less work for your Proxies. \r\nAll things like MOTD etc. are configurable and you have only edit it once. Another cool feature is that you can go to a maintenance mode directly and instant.\r\n\r\nA very important feature is that the only thing that must be open to the internet is your Comix ip and the port 22565 where Comix is running.\r\nNobody can know how many Proxies you have, which port there are running - nothing.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- IP-Blacklist\r\n- Commands (help, reload, kickall, etc..)\r\n- Whitelist (choose where is allowed to join, or allow all)\r\n- Customizable Ping Response (MOTD, online players, max players and sample text)\r\n- Colored MOTD\r\n- Maintenance mode (custom MOTD, custom kick message, custom version string)\r\n- Logging\r\n- Online/Offline detection for servers (automatically removing and adding to the LB)\r\n- Custom Address and Port binding for the Load-Balancer\r\n- As many target Server as you want\r\n- Load Balancing with simple Round-Robin\r\n- Based on Netty for high performance\r\n- Monitoring (Planned)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have trouble with configs or want to know command visit the [Comix Wiki](https://github.com/JackWhite20/Comix/wiki).\r\nHave you found an error or bug? Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/JackWhite20/Comix/issues)with a detailed description.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
